##What's this

Just a simple function library for working with XML DOM documents in Javascript. I use it as a compatibility layer, so browser differences can easily be dealt with. It supplies very basic methods like creating XML documents, converting between XML string and DOM and vice versa, getting/setting `textContent` and stuff like that.

This is very early, experimental version, I will make it better as I go.

##Requirements

Defined in a [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) format, so you need an AMD loader.

##Documentation

All the methods are documented with [JSDoc3](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc), you can find the generated HTML documentation in the **docs** folder.
